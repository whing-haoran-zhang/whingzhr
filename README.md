## Why whing? 
Hi there! I'm whing, the legendary name that was born from a keyboard-mashing moment back in 2010 when I first played the Roco Kingdom game. And thanks to the magical ability to create usernames at the speed of light by my random typing, the legendary name has been created. Over the years, this name has traveled far and wide, across games, forums, and social media platforms, even my Wi-Fi name.

Now(2024 version) I'm in my senior year of Nankai University & Neoma Business School(double degree), and will start my PhD career in 2025(hope to gradruate in 2030) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
